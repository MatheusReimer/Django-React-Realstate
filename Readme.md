## Welcome to my Python/Django - React - Project ##

<p>As the name of the project says, this project was made for a RealState company to use. </br>

The overall goal was to create a real estate website where basically a crud can be done - view, insert, delete and update properties.</br>
This in an interface that differentiates itself from others - which are usually made in wordpress.
</p>
<br></br>
## Features ##
<p>This project has the following features:</br>
Integration with database to save the users and the properties - PostgreSQL</br>
Smooth Interface using ReactJS</br>
Pagination</br>
CRUD's for the houses</br>
Ways of puting a selected propertie in the first page as "featured"</br>
Profile for every realtor</br>
